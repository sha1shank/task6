Passwords tested ranged from simple (e.g., Shashank123) to long passphrases.

Strength scores ranged from 76% for simple passwords to 100% for long, complex passphrases.

Best practices include using long passwords, mixing character types, avoiding personal info, using unique passwords, and considering passphrases.

Tips learned: length and variety improve security, passphrases are strong, and medium complexity is still vulnerable.

Common attacks:

Brute force — tries all combinations; prevented by long, complex passwords & MFA.

Dictionary attack — uses common password lists; prevented by avoiding real words and predictable patterns.

Complexity improves security by increasing combinations, resisting dictionary attacks, and slowing cracking tools.
